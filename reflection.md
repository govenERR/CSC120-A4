- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
It's definitely something new to think about, and it's hard to predict in advance. It's definitely another sign that OOP cannot be winged, and has to be planned out. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
TA hours worked well, along with online resources to fill out my Java syntax knowledge. I would reccomend thouroughly reading the test main method before writing the program, so you know what the functions are going to need to do. I accidentally wrote Engine.go() as if it were something you could directly say how long you were driving for, and that it wouldn't be infinitely looping until empty, if I had read README more thouroughly I could have saved myself some time.
